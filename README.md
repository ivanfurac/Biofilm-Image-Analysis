# Biofilm Image Analysis

## Project Overview
### Introduction
This project explores quantitative methods for biofilm image analysis. Biofilms are complex communities of bacteria attached to surfaces. Those bacterial cells also produce a polymeric matrix that connects and protects them. It has been shown that the development and formation (growth) of biofilm contain phases similar to those in the development of eukaryotic organisms. When biofilm is grown in a laboratory environment, photos can be taken during the development phases. Those photos can then be used for image segmentation and further analysis. Biofilm segments can be used to obtain different measurements (e.g., determining the biofilm surface area), which show how biofilm growth works.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project consisted of 721 biofilm photos taken every 6 minutes during biofilm growth. It was obtained from the Ruđer Bošković Institute in Zagreb.

### Tools and Methods
OpenCV is an open-source Python library that contains a large number of computer vision tools. It was used to perform biofilm image segmentation (separate biofilm from the background) and measure biofilm area and perimeter for every segment.

## Repository and Usage
Complete code that includes image loading, preprocessing, segmentation, and quantitative analysis, together with examples of segmented images, can be found in the Jupyter Notebook in the repository.
For Croatian readers, there is a PDF file that includes detailed description of the project.
